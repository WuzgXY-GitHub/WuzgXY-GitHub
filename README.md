### Hello there, I'm [WuzgXY](https://github.com/WuzgXY-GitHub) ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am WuzgXY, a student, and also an amateur translator from China.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on l10n of Minecraft mods and more (if you want me to keep or create localizaion of a mod, please remind me [here](https://github.com/WuzgXY-GitHub/WuzgXY-GitHub/issues)) or PM/DM me via any social media
- ðŸŒ± I am currently ~~on the way to~~ studying C++ & Java
- ðŸ¤” I am looking for help with Minecraft mod developing, not now tho
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/WuzgXY-GitHub/WuzgXY-GitHub/issues)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: WIP
- âš¡ I am a member of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LWHK" title="sp Litwordhoek">[<abbr title="sp Litwordhoek">LWHK</abbr>]è£‚æ–‡å”¬å®¢</a>, a group of free, free and free translators : )
- ðŸ˜¢ I have not got completely familiar with the Internet social etiquette, so I now apologize for my unpolite behavior sincerely

For modders:

I have decided against sending translations to official repositories, and instead of that I will send translations to the [CFPA repository](https://github.com/CFPAOrg/Minecraft-Mod-Language-Package/blob/1.16/README-en.md), which is a commonized CHS translation integration of over 1000 mods. It was just a little bit troublesome for me to synchronise the translations of both sides (official and CFPA), and there are benefits to do translating for CFPA, because it has a better reviewing-feedback translation processing system, and it provides better CHS character rendering for its translations. I will still update [NuclearCraft](https://github.com/turbodiesel4598/NuclearCraft) for its official repository, because there is a ModID conflict between NC and NCO in CFPA repository, but other mods I am working on will only be updated in CFPA repository.
